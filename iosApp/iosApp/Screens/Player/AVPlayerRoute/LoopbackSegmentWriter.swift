//
//  LoopbackSegmentWriter.swift
//  Continuum (iOS + tvOS) — Dolby Vision AVPlayer loopback route
//
//  Re-demuxes a remote source with libavformat, re-muxes it into fragmented
//  MP4 via the `mp4` muxer (the `hls` muxer isn't compiled into our
//  xcframework), and splits the output stream into HLS segments by parsing
//  ISO BMFF boxes as the muxer emits them.
//
//  Why this design:
//    - Our FFmpeg build only has the `mp4` muxer — no `hls`, no `segment`.
//      So we produce a single fragmented MP4 stream via the mp4 muxer with
//      `movflags = +frag_keyframe+delay_moov+default_base_moof`, which emits
//      `ftyp + moov` (init) followed by a series of multiplexed `moof + mdat`
//      pairs. We split those into segment files from Swift.
//    - AVPlayer's HLS pipeline requires proper `'dvh1'` FourCC on the video
//      track so it routes the stream through its DV-aware internal decoder.
//      We force that by setting the output stream's codec_tag. This is the
//      whole point of this path: AVPlayer via HLS honors dvcC / dvh1 and
//      invokes its own DV decoder even when the original source container
//      would not have been playable as a native-direct asset.
//
//  Threading:
//    All libavformat I/O runs on a dedicated serial queue
//    (`com.continuum.dv.mux`). The only cross-thread communication is the
//    initial start()/stop() and an Atomic callback that notifies the backend
//    when enough initial media is ready to serve (so AVPlayer can begin
//    loading the manifest without a guessing race).
